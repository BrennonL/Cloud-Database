# Overview

I used python and firebase_admin to access data and change data in the firebase cloud database. I did this to practice using databases and python. I also
wanted to practice using this so that I can use databases for game development.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running, a walkthrough of the code, and a view of the cloud database.}

# Cloud Database

I used Firebase database. The structure of my database was that I had students and each student had 4 grades that were floats.
The grades were a math, science, english, and history.

# Development Environment

I used python with the firebase_admin to connect to my firebase database.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* The first thing I want to work on is the notifications, I feel like there is so much potential with that.
* The second thing I want to work on is seeing if I can store images.
* The final thing I want to learn about is different cloud databases.
